Code that generates the terms of OEIS sequence [A367038](https://oeis.org/A367038)
and the images in [this blog post](https://mscroggs.co.uk/blog/106).

To generate the OEIS sequence, run:

```bash
python3 sequence.py
```

Note that this script will likely take around 4-6 hours to compute the 6th term of the sequence.
